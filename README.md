Heres a demonstration for a small N-body gravity simulation project in Python that I've been working on during my free time. 

I wanted to explore beyond the usual data analysis and science libraries that I'm familiar with and expand my knowledge into basic simulation and visualization tools like Pygame. This project allowed me to delve into visualizing simulations using Euler integration, a first-order numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations. Since Pygame is not commonly used in the data science realm, it was an interesting exercise in algorithm design and implementing mathematical principles.

This project also provided an opportunity for me to learn more about optimizing my code. Initially, the simulation could only handle around 20 bodies before experiencing performance issues. However, by making some straightforward code modifications for sprite generation and interactions between bodies, I was able to run the simulation with up to approximately 100 bodies simultaneously without significant trouble.

Additionally, I tried to create resemblances to unlikely and unstable star systems that can be found throughout the universe. Each star in the simulation corresponds to one of the main spectral types of stars, with the color, relative mass, and size accurately reflecting their respective star type. However, the scaled distance between stars is not accurately represented.

Red (Type M) - Examples of this star are the famous Betelgeuse, the 7th brightest start in our sky.

Yellow (Type G) - Examples of this star are our Sun and is set as the reference for mass and size for the other two stars in this system.

White / Light Blue (Type A) - Examples of this star are Sirius. This is the brightest star in our sky by far and almost double that of the second brightest.
